#File-System-Compress-App
This is a program which levels the logical hierarchical structure of directories and files in Unix Systems.
The compression is accomplished with gzip, but the whole data hierarchy is stored and accessed by 'mydiz'.
This project has been implemented for the Operating Systems course, in Departments of Informatics and 
Telecommunications, in University of Athens, Greece. The project workpaper is in greek, such as Readme file, 
however, both pictures on pdf and comments on code are enough to give the general impression of my implementation.
